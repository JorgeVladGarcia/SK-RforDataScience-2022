## What is R?
- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
- Used for data analysis and statistical software.
  + Created by statisticians _**Ross Ihaka**_ and _**Robert Gentleman**_ at the University of Auckland in 1992. 
  + Meets needs of statisticians to **analyze data and produce graphical models**. 
- **RStudio** is a free, open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the most common third-party UI. 
  + It provides a **built-in editor, version control, project management, and it works on all platforms**. 

## What is data science?
- Data science is a multidisciplinary approach to extracting insights from data.
  + **Research, math, statistics, programming, analytics, AI.**
- **Cleansing**, aggregating and manipulating data.
- **Analysis** (statistics, algorithms, analytics, AI models, machine learning and deep learning models, etc.). 
- Find **patterns and insights**, and transform them into insights. 
  + Validated through the **scientific method**.
- Results are shared through **data visualization** to see patterns and understand trends. 

## R in Data Science 
- Similar to other programming languages for computing tasks (C, Java and Perl) .  
- Built-in statistical mechanisms.
- **Freeware** Available at no charge under a free software license:
  + Unlike other commercial statistical tools (SAS, SPSS, Stata).
- **Packaging system**: main driver for popularity. 
  + **Increased R functions**.
  + Offers **ready-to-use statistical techniques, graphical devices, import/export, reporting, etc**. 

## Tydiverse
- Group of packages, one of the most popular among data scientists. 
  + **Collection of functions** (data import, cleaning, transformation, interactive and dynamic visualization).
  + **Easy start with data science tasks** (instead of writing algorithms from scratch). 

## Shortcomings
- R vs. Python: free to download, data manipulation, automation, data exploration.

- **Python**:
  + Better suited for scalable production environments.
  + General-purpose programming language (many uses along with data science and statistics). 
- **R**:
  + Optimized for statistics and analysis. 
  + Packages to make more customizable graphs.

## R vs. Python
| R is better for...                          | **Python is better for...**                                    |

| Creating graphs and visualization           | **Handling large amounts of data**                        |
| Building statistical models                 | **Building deep learning models**                         |
| Its robust ecosystem of statistical packages| **Non-statistical tasks (web scraping, saving databases)**|
